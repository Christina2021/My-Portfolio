## Description

I am a student currently learning web development üíª, and this is my portfolio site!  This site was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  Utilizing the CSS/Bootstrap grid system, this site is responsive to desktop, tablet, and mobile phone screens.

There will be 3 separate pages that you will find on my site (they will be accessible using the navigation bar at the top of each page):
‚≠ê The first page that you will see will be the home/about me page.  On this page, I talk a little bit about myself.
‚≠ê Another page will be my Portfolio page, where you will find other sites that I have put together.
‚≠ê The last page will be my Contact Me page.  This page will include a form that may be completed.  Please note that this form cannot actually be submitted at this time.

There will also be a LinkedIn icon in my footer that will take you to my LinkedIn profile when clicked (let's connect!). ![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)
